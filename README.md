# End-to-End : Late Arrival Analysis

<h2>This project is still WIP</h2>

<h3>Project Plan</h3>
Through this project I intend to generate synthetic patient data using packages like Faker in python to mimic patient appointment information.
Using this data I would like to build a dashboard on tableau to understand the problem of patients arriving late to the clinic.

Once the severity of the problem is gauged with the help of visualizations, I would like to build a predictor model that can output the risk of lateness based on basic patient information and past records.
